Unique selling point of python'
Object oriented programming

it supports 
functional programming
object	programming
procedural programming


If we can achieve a functional task 
 
What is objecct?
We try to solve real world issue with help of virtual world solutions


we need objcts to solve problems
everything is object in  real world


some employee objects needs an AC object


Objects have ATTRIBUTES

description of the object is called as attributes
and attributes have behaviour 


if we want to store something in objects we need  to use variables

if we want to do something functuions in oop is called methods
if we want objects to do something then it's called methods

to achieve anything in programming we need  to think about the object
We should thik about multiple objects and then think about how to connect them


Different concepts of OOPS are
1>  OBJECT
2> CLASS
3> ABSTRACTION
4> ENCAPSULATION
5> POLYMORPHISM

We use object and class together
but why are they important


sometimes designing is important than manufacturing

class is a design
object is a real stuff or instance 
object - instance of a class 
CLASS-  is a blueprint of  object or design of the object
