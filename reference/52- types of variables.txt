Variable has two types

1> Instance Variable 
2> Class Variable or static variable


What if i want to create a variable common for all objects''
if we define the variable inside init then it '
is an instance variable 

if we define the variable outside init then
it is called class variable

Example 


class Bike():
tyres = 2    --- these are class variables which are outside the init method but inside
		the class

def __init__(self):
	self.mil = 10
	self.mod = "apache"    -- these are instance variable which are inside init

	
class variable once changed will change all the objects


NAMESPACE -- is an area where you create and store object/variable

- Class namespace-- (wheels = 4)
- Object/ Instance namespace--  (self.mil = 10)

FInal point to remember we have instance and class variables
