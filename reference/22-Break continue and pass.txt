Break is used to jump out of the loop

x = int(input("enter the amount of candies for the user:"))

i =1
while i<=x:
	if i>av:
 	     print("Out of stock")
	         break

	print("CANDIES")
	i = i+1
print("Bye")


CONTINUE

to skip the remaining  statements


for i in range(1, 101):
    if i%3==0 or i%5==0:
        continue

    print(i,end="\t")
print("BYE")


or means either this or that
and means both


PASS means
WE need to just ignore the code


for i in range(1, 101):
    if i%2==0:
        pass

    else:
        print(i, end="\t")
print("Bye")


BREAK ,CONTINUE AND PASS

COntinue - it skips the remaining statements


for i in range(5):
    if i ==3:
	continue
  print("Hello", i)



for i in range(5):
    if i == 2:
        continue
    print("Hello",i)


break - won't continue with the loop
continue - skips the iteration
pass - ignores the if true statement


for example if you dont know how to use the function and if you want to keep the function 
then you need to pass
Normally to skip the block
