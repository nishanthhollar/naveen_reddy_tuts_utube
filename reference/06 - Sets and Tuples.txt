list can be of different types


Tuple almost same as list
in list we can change values in tuple we cannot change values


tup = (21, 36, 41, 45)
tu[1]
we can fetch values


we cannot change values

tuple has two methods ie count and  imdex
count - - counts the occurence of the numbers


when we are using tuples - we should not change the values

iterations in tuple are faster than lists



SET

SET - collection of unique elements

s = { 22, 25, 15, 21, 5}

Set - never follows a sequence
Set uses the concept of HASH 
hence it improves the performance of the program

In set InDEXING IS NOT SUPPORTED
WE CANT FETCH THE ELEMENTS IN SET

MAny Built in functions in set

LIst - collection of values, add, remove , update values

TUPLES - collection is immutable as we cannot change values

SETS - does not support duplicate values and also does not suppport sequence
