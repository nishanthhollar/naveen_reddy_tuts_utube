while loop is for certain iterations and for certain conditions

for loop works for sequence such as list, tuple ,etc

unlike while 
 we dont initialize the variable 
we dont check the condition
we don't increment or decrement the values

for i in list[]


for i in range(10):    --> to print 10  values with the last number 1

range(start point, end point, iteration)


for i in range(20,11,-1):



we can have if condition inside for



Nested for loop
