init is actually a constructor

class Computer():    #design

c1 = Computer()
in our system we have a special memory called Heap memory

here this obj takes some space in Heap memory
id(c1) ---- id  function gives the address of c1

Every time we create an object it takes two different spaces or creates new spaces



Question is how much memory does the object takes'
Size of the object? 
Depends on the no of variables of each variable

WHo allocates the size to the object?
Constructor  is responsible to assign or calculate the memory

It is all done internally


self is a pointer which  directs to objects based on where you are calling

c1.compare(c2)
the thing is c1 is comparing with c2 '
c1 becomes self and c2 becomes other
