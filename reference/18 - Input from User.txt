x = input()
x = int(input())

input is always a string type

by default




We dont have char format in python 
ch = input("Enter the char:")
print(ch[0])


only i want the first character 
ch = input("Enter a char") [0]
print(ch)


use a function called eval - to evaluate the function as well

result = eval(input("Enter an expr"))
print(result)

the eval function evaluates the complete expression



to pass values from cmd prompt  when i am running my cmd prompt

ARGV

argv - will be having multiple values which is a list

and to access these values i need to pass the index number

mycode.py 6 2
mycode.py has index number 0 
6 has index number 1 
2 has index number 2

import sys 
this imports the module argv

x = int(sys.argv[1])
y = int(sys.argv[2])

when i am running the python code i want to pass the values

for this we use agrv

it is a list which has multiple values

to use argv in python we need to import the module sys
import sys


x = sys.argv[1]
y = sys.argv[2]

for this we get the output as a string so hence we need to convert it into A int

x = int(sys.argv[1])
y = int(sys.argv[2])

we can take the input and find the answer
