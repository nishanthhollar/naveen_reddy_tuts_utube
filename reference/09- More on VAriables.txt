num = 5 

what will happpen in this scene

num is a box which has a value that is 5 and it has the address

id(num) -- this command is used to get the address of the value

id(name)--- command is used to get the address 
In python whenever we create the different variable with the same value 
they both will point to the same box 

hence that's where python is more efficient

id(k)

variable are also called TAGS
we are tagging everything

a = 9 
id(9)


Here Python is memory efficient because it points to the same address if the value is same


Whenever we have data and that is not used ,
 that's when GARBAGE COLLECTION is going to be used


HOW TO CREATE CONSTANTS

Make a variable constant - we use capital letters for the variables
PI = 3.14
type of the variable
type(PI)
