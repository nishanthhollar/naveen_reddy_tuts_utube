Object has 2 things :
1> variables
2>methods


Three types of methods 
1> Instance methods
2> class methods
3>static methods


here class methods and static methods are different


 Static or class variable is declared outside the constructor or any methods


IN Instance we have two types 
1> Accessor Methods
2> Mutator Methods

Accessor Methods -- to only fetch the value of instance methods

Mutator Methods --- to modify the value of instance methods or variables


Getters are fetching data
setters are setting the data

geters get the value -> get or Accessor methods
seters set the value  -> set or mutator methods

 if we are working with instance then we are using a self keyword or 
else we use a cls keyword

def info(cls):

if we want to create a class method then we need to use a 
special method or class methods which are decorators

@classmethod
def info(cls):	

--- this is how we define it and call it
print(Student.info())


If we want a method which has nothing to do with instance  or class variables 
then we will go for static methods


   @staticmethod
    def infq():
        print("THis method has nothing to do
 with class variables or instance variables then we are
 using this mehod that is static method ")

        print("THis method is static")

which is not involved with instance methods or cls or class methods
