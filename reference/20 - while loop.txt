repeating statements again and again 


we can apply loop 
while loop 
for loop 



i = 1

while (condition)
	print("Telusko")


i = 1

while (i<=5):
	print("Telusko")
	i = i+1

using F8 for the  debugger

use Debug option in the file

Initialization 
Condition
Decrement or Increment


First the program will complete the inner loop and then it jumps to the outer loop

for example 
in a week we have days and in days we have hours
in a day we have 24 hours' which is the inner loop
so first we need to finish the inner loop 
and later we need to finish the outer loop 
as 24hours in a day of sunday should be completed so that it can proceed to mondau



print("Telusko",end="")
to print the things on the same line
