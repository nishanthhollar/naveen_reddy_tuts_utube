These are conditional statements
where we need to make a decision

By using if we can make or form what kind of statements we want
to execute

if True it executes'

if False it does not execute  

indentation


Writing efficient code is important


Nested If -
one if inside another if


x = 2 

if x==1: 
            print("One")
if x==1: 
            print("One")
if x==1: 
            print("One")
if x==1: 
            print("One")


if we dont want to check for other number then we can use elif
elif --> else if

it doesn't check for other conditions
