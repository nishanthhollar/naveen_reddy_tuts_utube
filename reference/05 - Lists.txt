Having different types of data types
nums = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 12, 90]

Strings - collection of characters
nums[0]
nums[-1]
nums[0:4]
4 is exclusive


names = ["naveen", "santosh", "john"]


values = [9.7, "nishanth", 23]
- with different type of data

mil = [nums , names] - this list is inside another list


CERTAIN METHODS OR OPERATIONS
nums.append()
LISTS ARE MUTABLE - MUTABLE MEANS WE CAN CHANGE THE VALUES



Ctrl +SPace == popup




append = append at the end
in insert == it inserts in between and we can put it
nums.insert(2 , 77)
nums.remove ("any element in the list")


nums.pop(1) -- we are using the index


nums.pop() - without specifiying the index value the last element which is added is removed
use of STACK in data structures


to remove multiple values

del nums[2:] - this deletes all the elements from 2



To add multiple values 
we can  use extend 


TO LEARN OR READ OF THE PYTHON WE CAN GO FOR PYTHON DOCS

nums.extend([23, 45, 65])  - 
here we are adding or inserting many elements



IN-BUILT FUNCTIONS 

min(nums)
max(nums)
sum(nums)

nums.sort() - used for sorting

LIST IS MUTABLE SO WE CAN CHANGE VALUES EXTEND SORT AND MANY OTHER THINGS
