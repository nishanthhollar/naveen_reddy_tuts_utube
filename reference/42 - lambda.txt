Anonymous Function 
they are called lambda

def square(a):
	return a*a

result = square(5)

lambda is the anonymous function
Functions are objects in Python


f = lambda a : a*a

result = f(5)
print(result)


without name it can have multiple function 


FILTER MAP REDUCE

filter()
map()
reduce()


filter takes two arguments ie functions and iterable 
list = filter(function, iterable)

if we want a list

a = list(filter(function, iterable))








BIG DATA Beginning

map is used to change value

Take the chunk of data
we filter the data and map it and reduce it

Map - takes value and apply an operation and then we reduce the values


def update(n):
	
doubles = list(map(lambda n:  n+2,evens))

print(doubles)


We use functions so that it is reusable..


nums = [10, 20, 32, 34, 33, 41]
evens = list(filter(lambda n: n%2 == 0, nums))
print(evens)


MAP
Map is used to change the values of the list 

Map is used to change every value

doubles = list(map(function, iterable))
doubles = list(map(lambda a: a*a, list))

#REDUCE 

from functools import reduce
is the module from where we can use reduce method
Example - to get one value from the list of all values
that is how we reduce the  list


sum = reduce(function, sequence)

sum = reduce(lambda a,b : a+b,  doubles)
