IN real life we have parent and child relationship 
this is inheritance


All languages that follow oops concept uses inheritance

CLasses inherits the classes

 class A:
super class 
sub class
sub class inheriting from super class is known as single level inheritence

This is known as SINGLE LEVEL INHERITANCE

MULTI LEVEL INHERITANCE

class A():

def

class B(A):
def

class C(B):
def 

class C can access all the methods from A and B

MULTIPLE INHERITANCE --
it means that there are three classes 
class A 
class B and 
classs C 
CLass B is not inheriting from A
but Class C wants to access both A and B 
hence class C inherits from both A and B 
This is kNOWN as MULTIPLE INHERITANCE


class C(A, B):  -- multiple inheritance
