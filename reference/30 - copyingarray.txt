


Adding an  element to all the elements in the array
from numpy import *

arr = array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
arr = arr + 5
print(arr)




Adding two arrays

arr1 = array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
arr2 = array([6, 7, 8, 9, 10])

arr3 = arr1 + arr2
print(arr3)


THis is called Vectorized Operation 


Numpy stands for num - numerical
can do trignometric and mathematical operations

print(sin(arr1))
print(log(arr))

print(sqrt(arr))
print(sum(arr1))
print(min(arr1))
print(max(arr1))
print(sorted(arr1))

To concatentate the two arrays


HOW TO COPY AN ARRAY


opying the array 

arr2 = arr1 
print(arr1)
print(arr2)
print(id(arr1))
print(id(arr2))
they both will have same value and same address
This is known as ALIASING as we are creating new alias for the same objects
print(concatenate([arr1, arr2])




.view() --> function that creates a new array  with a different location

arr1.view()
we have two different variables with two different address location


we have TWO DIFFERENT TYPES of copying 
1. Shallow Copy
2. Deep Copy
 


ShALOW COPY

When the value is modified in one array and 
the values are changing for 
both the arrays which we don't want 
then it is known as shallow copying



DEEP COPY

two arrays that are not linked with each other in any way

arr1.copy() -- this is the function which gives the deep copy 
arr2 = arr1.copy() ---> the changes in the copy is reflected to the first array
