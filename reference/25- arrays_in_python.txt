ARRAY - 
we need to have all the values of same type

values should be int
values should be float


array's do not have a fixed size in python
if we want to increase the size then we can increase it or if we want 
to decrease the size then we can decrease it
 

if we want to add elements then we can use append
 find element - index() where we can fetch the index number



import array


In array we need to specifiy the type and values


In array we need to specify the type and the values


unsigned - there is no negative range

signed - there is negative range

vals = array('i', [5,9, 6,8])
i means integer values 

bufffer_info() - gets the address and size of the array
output-
(16130016, 5) - address, size


typecode
prints the type of the code we are working with

add value - append()
remove value - remove()

vals.reverse()

NewArr = array(vals.typecode, (a for a in vals))  ---> as i dont know the value 
i will take it from the other values



Using while loop
#USing while loop
vals = array('i', [1, 4, 5, 7, 10])
newArr = array(vals.typecode, (a*a for a in vals))
i = 0
while i<len(newArr):
    print(newArr[i])
    i +=1




Using for loop

#for loop
vals = array('i', [1, 4, 5, 7, 10])
newArr = array(vals.typecode, (a*a for a in vals))  #i am taking values from other arrays and squaring it


for e in newArr:
    print(e)
