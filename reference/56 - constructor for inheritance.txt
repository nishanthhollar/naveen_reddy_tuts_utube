 Constructor in Inheritance
Method Resolution Order (MRO)
Super class cannot access features of sub class



IF we create object of sub class it will first
try to find the init of sub class 
if it is not found  then it will call init of Super class



If we want  to call the init of both the classes then we use the keyword
super

We can work constructor with inheritance



the super class prefers or goes from left to right
this going from left to right is known as Method Resolution Order


We can use super method to use other classes
TO represent super class we use super method
